# Solution using SCALA

The classes designed to solve this challenge can be found in the folder *[Scala/first-part/src/](https://github.com/gabrielmd/semantix/tree/master/Scala/first-part/src)*.


## First part

File `Challenge.scala` can be compiled and executed passing the parameter `first-part/aux/edges.dat`. 

The output is the rank of vertices based on their closeness.

Example of output:

``` 
 vertice, centrality
 44, 0.005988024
 88, 0.00591716
 33, 0.005882353
 74, 0.0058479533
 20, 0.0058139535
```

## Second part

In the folder `restAPI`, the file `scripts/startup.sh` must be executed to start the WebServer. 
There are two APIs that will run at the port $8080$: 

 * `GET /centrality` -- there is no extra parameter. It returns the rank of vertices based on their closeness.
 * `POST /addEdge` -- there are two parameters (`a` and `b`) to identify the vertices. It will add the new edge and recompute the closeness of the graph. It returns a message of success when the procedure is over.

For the second part, it was used the framework *Spring* to provide the RESTful interfaces.

Examples of outputs:

 * `GET /centrality`
